Question: 
How to properly style OSM road layer in QGIS for a military-style map?

Styling OpenStreetMap (OSM) road line layers in QGIS for a military-style map requires attention to clarity, hierarchy, and aesthetics that align with military cartographic standards. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

### 1. **Understand the Data**
- **Road Types**: Ensure your OSM data includes attributes that distinguish road types (e.g., highways, primary roads, secondary roads, tracks, etc.).
- **Layer Structure**: Organize roads by type in your QGIS project (e.g., use categorization or separate layers for each road type).

---

### 2. **Set Up a Military Color Scheme**
Military maps often use subdued colors for roads and terrain to emphasize operational information. Use a palette like:
- **Primary Roads (e.g., highways)**: Black or dark brown.
- **Secondary Roads**: Dark gray or muted brown.
- **Tertiary Roads**: Light gray or muted tan.
- **Tracks/Trails**: Dashed lines in light gray or brown.
- **Railways**: Black with parallel dashed lines or dark gray.

---

### 3. **Symbolize Roads**
- **Line Widths**: Use thicker lines for major roads and thinner lines for minor roads. This establishes a visual hierarchy.
  - Highways: 2.0–3.0 px
  - Primary Roads: 1.5–2.0 px
  - Secondary Roads: 1.0–1.5 px
  - Trails: 0.5 px
- **Line Styles**: Apply styles to distinguish road types.
  - Solid for highways and primary roads.
  - Dashed or dotted for secondary roads and trails.

#### Example Style Setup:
- Go to **Layer Properties > Symbology**.
- Choose **Categorized** or **Rule-based** rendering.
- Use the `highway` attribute for classification and assign colors and line styles.

### 4. **Add Buffers for Emphasis**
To make roads stand out:
- Add a **buffer layer** or use **dual symbols**:
  - Outer buffer: Light, semi-transparent color (e.g., beige or white).
  - Inner line: Darker, solid color for the road itself.

---

### 5. **Use Labels for Key Roads**
Labeling is crucial in military maps:
- **Font Style**: Use a simple, legible font (e.g., Arial or sans-serif).
- **Font Size**: Adjust size based on road importance.
- **Placement**: Place labels above or alongside roads, avoiding overlaps.
- Enable **buffered labels** for clarity:
  - Go to **Layer Properties > Labels**.
  - Set a buffer (e.g., white or light gray, 1–2 px).

---

### 6. **Incorporate Military Symbology**
For additional context, overlay NATO military symbols (e.g., friendly/hostile units, logistics routes):
- Use **SVG symbols** or import symbols as layers.
- Align these symbols with road features to show convoy routes, choke points, or supply lines.

---

### 7. **Apply a Base Map and Coordinate System**
- **Base Map**: Use a subdued base map like a grayscale terrain map or no base map for clarity.
- **Coordinate System**: Use a military standard like UTM or MGRS for consistent grid referencing.

---

### 8. **Finalize with Map Composition**
- Add a **legend** that clearly defines road types and symbology.
- Include a **scale bar** and **north arrow**.
- Use a military-style font for titles and annotations (e.g., DIN 1451 or similar sans-serif fonts).

---

### 9. **Export and Test**
- Export the styled map and test its readability.
- Adjust line weights, colors, or labels if certain features dominate too much or blend into the background.

---

This approach ensures your OSM road layers are styled effectively for a military-style map, emphasizing clarity and functionality.
