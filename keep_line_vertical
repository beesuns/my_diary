To ensure lines remain perfectly vertical or horizontal in the QGIS Layout Manager, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Use the Alignment Snapping Tool**
QGIS Layout provides snapping tools to help you draw precise vertical or horizontal lines.

- Open the **Layout Manager** and add a new layout or edit an existing one.
- In the layout toolbar, enable **Snapping Guides**:
  - Go to **View > Snapping Guides** or click the snapping icon in the toolbar.
  - This ensures that your lines snap to a grid or other layout elements for alignment.

---

### 2. **Use the Shift Key While Drawing**
- Select the **Add Line** tool from the toolbar.
- Hold down the **Shift key** while drawing the line:
  - This constrains the line to 0°, 45°, or 90° angles, ensuring vertical or horizontal alignment.

---

### 3. **Manually Adjust Line Orientation**
If you've already drawn a line and want to make it perfectly vertical or horizontal:
- Select the line in the layout.
- Open the **Item Properties** panel on the right.
- Adjust the **Start and End Coordinates**:
  - For a vertical line, ensure the X-coordinates of both ends are identical.
  - For a horizontal line, ensure the Y-coordinates of both ends are identical.

---

### 4. **Snap to Grid**
Using a grid ensures consistent alignment:
- Go to **View > Grid and Guides > Show Grid** to display a grid.
- Enable **Snapping**:
  - Go to **View > Snapping Guides > Snap to Grid**.
- Draw or adjust your lines so they align with the grid.

---

### 5. **Align Multiple Elements**
To align lines with other elements:
- Select the line and the reference element (e.g., another line, box, or text).
- Use the **Align Toolbar**:
  - Go to **Layout > Align Items** or use the toolbar options (e.g., Align Left, Align Top).
- This ensures the selected elements align perfectly.

---

### 6. **Use the Ruler for Precision**
- Enable the **Ruler** from the layout view to check alignment visually.
- Adjust the line endpoints using the ruler as a guide.

---

By combining these methods, you can ensure your lines are perfectly vertical or horizontal, maintaining precision and professional alignment in your QGIS layout.
